# Repository Evolution

We document the how and the why and in what sequence of this repository.

### Setup Repository

This is deliberately a single-process application repository that we initialize with the following:

```bash
uv init --package --python 3.13 --build-backend hatch
```

`uv` was deliberately chosen due to ease of use and a preference for more modern and performant tooling.
